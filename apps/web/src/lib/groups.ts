/**
 * Reporting-group model for the Wave 2 contract.
 *
 * The v2 ledger counts per `(category, gender, component, bucket)`. This module
 * turns that into the Art. 9 shaped objects the report needs, and owns the two
 * rules that keep the output honest:
 *
 *   1. Category LABELS never go on chain. The contract stores
 *      `categoryKey = hash("gotit:catkey:v2" || label)`. The mapping from key to
 *      label lives in the report, published by the employer, because the
 *      Directive requires the published breakdown to be readable.
 *   2. A figure is only ever sourced through the circuit's `getHistogram`,
 *      which returns 0 below the anonymity threshold. Reading raw ledger state
 *      would bypass that, so this module treats raw state as a way to discover
 *      WHICH groups exist and never as a source of published counts.
