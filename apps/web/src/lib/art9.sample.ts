/**
 * An ILLUSTRATIVE report for demos, docs and screenshots.
 *
 * Deliberately explicit about being fake. It exists because a young chain has no
 * data, and "nothing publishable" is the right answer but a useless thing to
 * show a judge. Every surface that renders it carries an explicit banner, the
 * period label is marked SAMPLE, and no code path can present it as a live read:
 * `buildV2Report` is the only live path and it never falls back here.
 *
 * The figures are chosen to exercise the parts that matter — a gap that crosses
 * the 5% threshold, a one-sided group that must be suppressed, and base kept
 * apart from variable.
